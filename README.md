## Introduction
This project aims to predict median house prices using various machine learning models. The goal is to compare different models and identify the one with the best predictive performance for the given dataset.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Comparison of different machine learning models

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/iangozl/Housing_Prices.git
cd Housing_Prices
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Explore the provided Jupyter Notebooks for detailed analysis and visualization.
Run the Python scripts to train and evaluate machine learning models.
Customize the models and parameters as needed for your specific use case.

## Models

The following machine learning models are implemented and compared in this project:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Results
Detailed results and performance metrics for each model are available in the Results directory.
